If you get a message saying "Corrupt PDF file: does not start with %PDF", it may be because your script - either mPDF or an error in your PHP code - has output an error message. The browser is expecting a file in PDF format, which should start with "%PDF" and instead it gets some text like an error message.

To show error message(s):

{% highlight php %}
<?php

<?

$mpdf = new \Mpdf\Mpdf();

$mpdf->debug = true;

...

$mpdf->Output();

?>
{% endhighlight %}

## Adding exit

A number of errors can be caused by not explicitly ending your script with <span class="parameter">$exit;</span>
