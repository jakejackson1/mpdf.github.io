mPDF is optimised to output HTML code, i.e. parsing the HTML markup. If you want to create a PDF file from a long text
file (e.g. a PHP script file) preserving <span class="smallblock">TAB</span>s and multiple spaces, use the function
`preparePreText()`. Note this is not part of the mPDF class.

This will surround the text with &lt;pre&gt; tags whilst preventing any &lt;pre&gt; tags included in the text from
being parsed. It also allows use of a text string marker (<span class="parameter">$formfeed</span>) to be replaced
by a formfeed in the output file.
